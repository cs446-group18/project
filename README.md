## Getting Started
This project uses Android 8.1 SDK Level 27.

Install:
- Android Studio: https://developer.android.com/studio/install
- Emulator: Configure Pixel 6 API 30 AVD (Android Virtual Device) under Tools >> Device Manager. 

*If error: "Emulator process has terminated" when trying to run the app in the emulator, go to Tools >> SDK Manager. In the Android SDK tab in the side menu, click on the SDK Tools tab and checkmark the Android Emulator option. Click OK to update the version. This should fix the error (first launch is extremely slow and laggy, but should improve after that).*

## Tech Stack
* Kotlin
